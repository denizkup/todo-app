# Just an another todo-app with unnecessary features

Todo app's backend developed with Node.js and MongoDB, its frontend developed with React+Typescript.

Todos are saved to the MongoDB to save permanently. User can create,delete,update and list todos.
For now users can only registered with API only, to accomplish that Postman configuration file is added.

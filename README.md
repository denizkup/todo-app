# Just another TypeScript + Node.js boilerplate

There are dozens of boilerplates and this is one of them. While learning TypeScript (still learning), I found several boilerplates and this is a combination of them.


## Installation 
```bash
    npm install
````

## Scripts
To run available scirpt
```bash
    npm run 'script_name'
```
Available scripts:

    start:dev  -> To run in development mode with nodemon
    start:prod -> To run in production
    build:dev  -> To build for development
    build:prod -> To build for production
    test       -> To run all tests with jest

## Test

Place all test related codes into `__tests__` folder. To run individual test, run command below.

```bash
  npx jest 'test_name'
```
# todo-app
